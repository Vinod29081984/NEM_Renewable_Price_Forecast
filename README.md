# NEM_Renewable_Price_Forecast
Analysis and forecasting of electricity prices based on renewable energy generation in QLD's National Electricity Market (NEM):
This project explores how increasing renewable energy generation (such as solar and wind) influences electricity pricing trends in Queenslandâ€™s National Electricity Market (NEM). The study focuses on forecasting electricity prices using statistical and deep learning models, supported by scenario simulations.

##  Project Objective

**Research Question:**  
*How does increasing renewable energy generation influence electricity pricing trends in Queenslandâ€™s National Electricity Market?*

The goal is to:
- Analyze historical electricity and renewable generation data
- Develop accurate forecasting models for electricity prices
- Simulate different renewable energy scenarios to assess pricing impacts

##  Methods Used

- Data Collection & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Forecasting Models:
  - SARIMA
  - SARIMAX (with exogenous renewable input)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)
- Scenario Simulations:
  - +20% and â€“20% renewable generation
  - Peak-hour generation and storage-redeployment strategy

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- A weak negative correlation was found between renewable output and electricity prices.
- SARIMAX slightly outperformed SARIMA by incorporating renewable data.
- LSTM provided the lowest forecasting error but was less interpretable.
- Scenario simulations showed clear pricing sensitivity to renewable variation.
